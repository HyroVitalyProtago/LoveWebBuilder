<h2>LÖVE Web Builder</h2>
<p>This is a tool to package, build and run <a href="https://love2d.org/">LÖVE</a> games for the web.</p>

<h3>How</h3>
<p>The web packaging relies on the pre-built <a href="https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/love.js/">Love.js by Tanner Rogalsky</a>.<br>
The available Love.js build is based on version 0.11.1 (a pre-release of the final 11.0) and not the latest version.</p>
<p>It is intended for smaller games (a few megabytes) and focuses on compatibilty, performance and ease of deployment and running.</p>

<h3>⇒ <a href="./package">Package Your Game</a></h3>
<p>Use this to package your project and get a shiny deployable HTML5 page.</p>

<h3>⇒ <a href="./run-project">Run a LÖVE Project</a></h3>
<p>Here you can directly run your project on the web player and check compatiblity.</p>

<h3>⇒ <a href="./run-code">Write and Execute Code</a></h3>
<p>An easy way to test the web player with a single LUA file.</p>

<h3><a name="hints"></a>Hints for running your game on the web</h3>
<p>
<li>Big games don't perform well, try to keep asset file sizes low (use <a href="http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm">pngout</a> and lower sampled .OGG files). Make sure you don't have unused files in your package.</a>
<li>Test your game thoroughly to ensure that the selected amount of memory is enough. It might only crash in some rare case, adding a few MB over the minimal amount is advised.</li>
<li><a href="http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html">FFI</a> is not supported so the libraries used by the LÖVE3D projects are not working</li>
<li>Support for threading on the web seemed barely working, very unstable and cumbersome so I had to disabled it. This means LUA threads and audio sources with type 'stream' are not working.</li>
<li>Shaders can behave different (or not work at all) depending on the browser. Also shaders that work on desktop OpenGL can easily not work in the WebGL context.</li>
<li>Some TTF fonts that work on desktop platforms are not supported and can give weird error messages like 'cursors not supported' or 'function' when they are being used. <a href="http://www.dsg4.com/04/extra/bitmap/index.html">These pixel-fonts</a> work fine.</li>
